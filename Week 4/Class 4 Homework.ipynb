    "# Week 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with arXiv Papers\n",
    "This week marks a major shift in your AI agent's capabilities: you’ll build the foundation for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to scientific research. Rather than relying on an LLM’s memory alone, RAG architectures allow your agent to search a structured knowledge base and generate grounded, document-aware answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a RAG pipeline using recent arXiv cs.CL papers, converting them into searchable chunks, embedding them, and indexing them with FAISS. You’ll then implement a simple query interface that takes a user question, retrieves the top relevant chunks, and displays them for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week marks the beginning of building your agent’s private research knowledge base—a semantic index that you’ll evolve into a full-featured hybrid database in Week 5."

This proves the effectiveness |20 of staged adaptation and the importance of process guidance. 5.3 Baselines We introduce the comparison setting of our agentic RL training approach agains other training and prompting approach, then further compare Deep-DxSearch against seven competing baseline methods including domain- adapted medical LLMs, foundation models, retrieval-augmented methods, and multi-agent frameworks, etc. Basic Training & Prompting Approach • Vanilla model with direct inference. We only prompt the vanilla model to direct diagnose according to its internal knowledge without any post-training. The medical retrieval corpus is disabled under this setting. The input is free-text clinical presentation and no chain-of-thought inference is implemented. • Training-free RAG-augmented prompting. For comparison, we also include a prompt engineering based approach using the same retrieval corpus (the LLM can interact with the corpus at any time it decided to do). In this inference-only setting, we apply the same prompt design (see Supplemen- tary Materials) as in our agentic RL training, but without incorporating any reward mechanism for optimization. • Target-only RL training. In contrast to our agentic RL training approach, this target-only training variant removes the policy reward that guides the optimization of the reasoning and retrieval processes, resulting in supervision based solely on target outputs. For a fair comparison, we adopt the same environment settings and training parameters as in our full-component agentic RL training. Competing Clinical Diagnostic Methods • General-purpose large language model. In this work, we employ the Qwen2.5 [52] and Llama3.1 [53] series as the vanilla backbones for RL training. Specifically, considering the cost-effect tradeoff, we use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct. For larger-scale LLMs as comparison baselines, we adopt GPT-4o (proprietary) [30] and DeepSeek-R1 (open-source) [31]. In particular, we access their official APIs with the models DeepSeek-R1-0528 and gpt-4o-2024-11-20. • Biomedical CLIP-based encoder. These models are trained on large-scale biomedical text corpora using a contrastive learning approach. In this work, we adopt a representative approach: MedCPT [32] for comparison, treating the clinical presentation as the “article” and the diagnosis as the “query.” Specifically, we use the official Hugging Face checkpoint ncbi/MedCPT-Cross-Encoder. • Medical large language model. Domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) of general LLMs on medi- cal corpora is a common approach for clinical adaptation [54]. In this work, we adopt the newly developed Baichuan-M1 model as a baseline with the official checkpoint baichuan-inc/Baichuan-M1-14B-Instruct. • Medical foundation model. We include this category as multi-modal, multi-task generalisers. Medical foundation models such as Meditron [55] and MedFound [56] demonstrate strong capabilities across diverse clinical scenarios, including diagnosis. In this work, we select MedGemma [34] for its improved instruction-following ability and more recent medical knowledge cutoff. The official checkpoint used is google/medgemma-27b-text-it. • Medical RAG-based framework. Different from our retrieval approach, these methods typically rely on a general medical knowledge corpus specified via a system prompt, without fine-tuning. In this work, we include the MedRAG [35] framework, following the official implementation Teddy-XiongGZ/MedRAG. • Chain-of-Thought agentic model. This type of model incorporates the chain-of-thought paradigm through supervised\n",
      "End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning Qiaoyu Zheng1,2, Yuze Sun1, Chaoyi Wu1, Weike Zhao1,2, Pengcheng Qiu1,2, Yongguo Yu3, Kun Sun3, Yanfeng Wang1,2, Ya Zhang1,2,† and Weidi Xie1,2,† 1Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China 2Shanghai AI Laboratory, Shanghai, China 3Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China Accurate diagnosis remains a central challenge for medical large language models due to inherent knowledge limitations and hallucinations. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and tool-augmented agentic methods show potential in mitigating these issues, their suboptimal utilization of external knowledge and the decoupling of the feedback-reasoning traceability, stemming from insufficient supervision, re- main key limitations. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crucially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep- DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch’s diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. Data, code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/Deep-DxSearch. 1 INTRODUCTION AI-driven medical diagnosis [1] presents unique challenges, as it must replicate the precision and context- awareness of clinical decision-making [2]. Such decision-making is inherently evidence-based, drawing on up-to-date guidelines, historical patient records, and structured medical knowledge to map presenting symptoms to plausible diseases [3, 4]. Recent LLM-based agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems [5, 6, 7] have highlighted promising directions for building more powerful LLM-based diagnostic systems. By leveraging the orchestration capabilities of LLMs in conjunction with retrieval tools [8, 9], these systems can look up disease guidelines [10], search for related background knowledge [11], and, most critically for diagnosis, match similar diagnostic cases [12], ultimately synthesizing transparent and traceable diagnostic reasoning interwoven with retrieved evidence and analytical insights. While promising, current agentic RAG system designs are typically inference-only and not trained end-to-end, which makes them fragile in high-stakes diagnostic environments where the agent may need to perform multiple retrievals [13] interleaved with evolving reasoning processes and former noisy retrieval feedback [14]. In particular, they exhibit THREE key limitations: • Rigid retrieval–reasoning interleaved workflow. Inference-only designs [15, 16] lack joint optimiza- tion, leaving models unable to decide when tools or reasoning should be performed.\n"

    "* **Retrieval Report:** A brief report showing at least 5 example queries and the top-3 retrieved passages for each, to demonstrate system performance.\n",
    "* **FastAPI Service:** The FastAPI app code (e.g. `main.py`) and instructions on how to run it. The `/search` endpoint should be demonstrable (e.g. returning top-3 passages in JSON for sample queries).\n",

    "* Implement a simple reranking step: for example, after retrieving candidates with FAISS, re-score them with a cross-encoder model for finer ranking.\n",
    "* Use metadata: consider filtering or weighting chunks by paper metadata (e.g. year, authors, keywords) to improve relevance if needed.\n"
